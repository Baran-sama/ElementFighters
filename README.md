# Element Fighters

Element Fighters is a console-based, turn-based fighting game where players choose elemental characters and battle using unique abilities. The game demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Features
- Six unique characters with different moves and abilities.
- Turn-based combat system with normal, special, and ultimate moves.
- AI opponents for single-player mode.
- Cooldown system for more strategic gameplay.

## Areas for Improvement:

- AI Logic:

The AI is quite basic and could be made smarter to enhance the gameplay experienceâ€‹(Game). Currently, it just selects random moves, which might not challenge players enough. 

-Error Handling:

You might want to add some error handling to prevent the game from breaking under unexpected input or conditions.
Expand Gameplay:

While the characters and moves are varied, adding some additional mechanics like status effects (e.g., stun, heal) or strategic elements (like choosing a defense move) could make the game more engaging.
